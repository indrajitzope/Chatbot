# Chatbot
Creating basic chatbot for natural language processing and rule-based responses. It has below features:
1.  Rule-based chatbot with predefined patterns and responses.
2.  Randomized responses for variety.
3.  Handles basic intents: greetings, goodbyes, and thanking.
The script uses regular expressions to match user input with predefined patterns for intents. For example, greeting, goodbye. If a pattern matches, the bot selects a random response from its list under the matched intent. If no match is found, it uses a default response. Now, the user can exit or quit by typing it and the conversation will come to an end.
